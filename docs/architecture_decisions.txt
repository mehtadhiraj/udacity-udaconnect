Frontend, Persons and Connections services uses REST APIS for message passing. 
 - As REST APIS are generaly used to fetch the resources. We do not need to have persistent connections with the server. 
   Hence decided to have a REST APIS for the mentioned services. 

Location service excepts gRPC connections and produce kafka messages
 - gRPC is great for real time exchange of data and also help us maintain the connection without further TCP handshakes. 
   As people move, location changes hence we can send the location from a client device to service in real time. 
   Also location can be send concurrently by loads of users. Hence gRPC can be of help here. 
- As there are concurrent submissions on location service, processing data one by one is not a feasible solution. Hence its better
  to publish the message on Kafka and necessary service will consume the data and process them.

Event consumer service consumes kafka event. 
 - This service responsibility is to consume Kafka event and process them as per the need. 
   Here it consumes the location data. We can further store these data by making an HTTP call to connections service. 
   Hence this service can be an interface between kafka events and other services.
